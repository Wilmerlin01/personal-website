                            This website project was built using Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, and is hosted through Amazon Web Services.  Having primarily done work on the backend, I have been eager to learn more about what web development entails and so this project began as a way for me to dip my toes into the area that is frontend web development.   Iâ€™m currently utilizing what I have learned to develop a digital space to showcase my projects as well as give insight on who I am beyond my career.

                            Presently, this website highlights some of the projects I have done and contains a simple about me page.  My vision for this website is to continue expanding it beyond its current state as a simple portfolio.  As my skills grow and my interests evolve, I plan to add new pages and content that reflect my personal and professional journey.  I see this website as a stage for not only showcasing my work, but also to share my perspectives and experiences stepping into the tech industry as a new grad and how I might grow..  I hope to publish resources and tutorials that can help others learn and grow in their own careers.  Ultimately, I want to develop this website into a hub of materials others can use as inspiration as well as a journal of sorts for myself to one day look back and reminisce on my journey.
